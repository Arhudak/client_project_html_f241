                    <h3>Self-Care For Incidents Of Campus Climate Concerns</h3>
                    <p>When faced with social injustices and bias incidents, it is extremely difficult to cope and know what to do. Feeling overwhelmed with the current socio-political state, experiencing discrimination, or being impacted by contentious people or policies increases stress which remains correlated to negative mental health outcomes. During these times, it remains imperative that we take care of ourselves, take care of loved ones, and take care of our campus community. We all have the power to spread kindness, celebrate diversity and inclusion, and promote social justice.</p>

Togetherall is a clinically moderated, online peer-to-peer mental health community that reaches and empowers a diverse population of students to anonymously seek and provide support.</p>
