        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our Meet the Staff pages -- we hope this information gives you a sense of "who we are" as well as "what we do". Our staff includes fully licensed professional staff in social work and psychology. All CAPS clinicians identify as “generalists” and are comfortable working with issues such as anxiety, depression, eating concerns, family and relationship distress, hostility, substance abuse, and academic concerns, among others. Many of our staff also have specialized interests and expertise, which you can find in their individual biography pages below.</p>
